Status note:currently building ST1 stage

This repository is intentionally scoped to platform foundation only:

- Java 21 Spring Boot core API
- Next.js TypeScript dashboard shell
- Python 3.12 AI/OCR worker skeleton
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Flyway migrations, Docker Compose
- Security and architecture documentation

AI, frontend, chatbot, and connector components must never directly write trusted business data. Future mutations must go through typed core-api command services, authentication, authorization, tenant policy, deterministic validation, approval gates, transactions, audit events, and outbox events.
